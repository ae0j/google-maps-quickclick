# **Google Maps QuickClick - Search to Maps**

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ae0j/google-maps-quickclick/main/media/mapq.png)

**Open Google Maps from the Search page by clicking on a map image.**

This simple Chrome extension restores and enhances functionality for Google Search by making map images directly clickable, leading you instantly to the corresponding location in Google Maps. It also provides instant access to Google Maps via a new button for searches that display multiple locations.

## **Available in the Chrome Web Store**

Easily install the Google Maps QuickClick extension directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-maps-quickclick-se/ippkeibgeeegemmdjhlhbdlcfjkgjann).

## **Motivation**

Following the new EU legislation, changes were made to Google Search in the European Economic Area (EEA), affecting how map results are linked and displayed. Specifically, map results from searches no longer link directly to Google Maps, and the Maps link at the top of the Search page has been removed. This extension seeks to provide a workaround for users affected by these changes, restoring direct access to Google Maps from search results. For more information on the legislation changes, please visit [Googleâ€™s blog post](https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/complying-with-the-digital-markets-act/).

## **Features**

- Clickable map images: Directly open Google Maps by clicking on map results within Google Search.
- New button for multi-location searches: Easily access Google Maps with a new button for searches displaying multiple map points.
- Automatic detection of dark mode: The extension adapts its appearance based on your system's theme settings for a seamless browsing experience.

## **Installation**

1. Download and unpack the extension.
2. Navigate to **`chrome://extensions`** in your Chrome browser.
3. Enable Developer mode (top right).
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the unpacked extension directory.

## **Usage**

Simply perform a Google Search as you normally would. When a map result appears:

- Click on any map image to directly open the detailed view in Google Maps.
- For searches that return multiple locations, use the newly added "View on Google Maps" button to explore all locations on Google Maps.
